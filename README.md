## üìç About The Project

**Niyam** is an ambitious final-year project designed to tackle a fundamental challenge within Nepal's legal landscape: the accessibility and comprehensibility of legal documents. The law serves as a cornerstone of society, yet legal texts are often intricate, filled with complex terminology, and extensively cross-referenced, making them difficult to navigate for citizens, legal professionals, and even policymakers.

### The Problem

> Legal writings are difficult to understand and navigate because they frequently relate to other laws or papers and depend heavily on internal references (such as "as indicated in section X, subject to subsection Y"). This creates a confusing web of information that is dispersed across multiple government websites and archives, lacking a unified, organized, and user-friendly system. This information overload hinders legal awareness, slows down research, and creates a barrier to civic engagement.

### Our Solution

Niyam aims to bridge this gap by creating an innovative, open-source digital platform. The system is designed to simplify Nepali legal documents by providing:

- User-friendly tools for navigating complex internal and external references.
- Clear, accessible information about legislative history.
- A structured, centralized repository for all legal content.

By enhancing the clarity, accessibility, and research capabilities of legal texts, Niyam empowers lawyers, Members of Parliament, students, and the general public, fostering a more informed and efficient engagement with Nepal's legal framework.
